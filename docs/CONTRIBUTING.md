```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions and idioms
- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Write clear, concise comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(workflow): add support for custom templates

fix(github): handle rate limiting gracefully

docs: update installation instructions

test(claude): add unit tests for prompt generation
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```
feature/add-custom-templates
fix/github-rate-limiting
docs/update-api-reference
refactor/workflow-engine
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. Ensure your code follows the project style
2. Add or update tests for your changes
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Run all checks locally:

```bash
make check
```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Create PR from your fork:**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Select your feature branch

2. **Use the PR template:**
   - Fill out the provided PR template
   - Include clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues

3. **PR Checklist:**
   - [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
   - [ ] Self-review of the code completed
   - [ ] Tests added/updated for new functionality
   - [ ] Documentation updated if needed
   - [ ] All CI checks pass
   - [ ] Changes are backwards compatible (or breaking changes documented)

### PR Review Process

1. **Automated Checks:**
   - Tests must pass
   - Linting must pass
   - Security scans must pass
   - Build must succeed

2. **Code Review:**
   - At least one maintainer review required
   - Address all review comments
   - Keep discussions professional and constructive

3. **Merge:**
   - PRs are merged by maintainers
   - Usually squash-merged to keep history clean
   - Branch will be deleted after merge

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific package tests
go test ./pkg/workflow/...

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run end-to-end tests
make test-e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% test coverage
- Include both positive and negative test cases

**Example test structure:**

```go
func TestWorkflowEngine_ProcessIssue(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    *Result
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name:    "valid issue URL",
            input:   "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123",
            want:    &Result{WorkflowID: "wf_123"},
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions/methods
2. **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests** - Test performance characteristics

### Security Issues

For security vulnerabilities:

- **DO NOT** create public issues
- Follow our [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md)
- Report to security@ccagents.dev
- Allow time for investigation and fix

## Development Tips

### Debugging

- Use the `--verbose` flag for detailed output
- Set `CCAGENTS_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for debug logs
- Use Go debugger (delve) for complex issues
- Check logs in `~/.ccagents/logs/`

### Performance

- Profile code using Go pprof tools
- Monitor memory usage
- Consider concurrent operations carefully
- Cache expensive operations when appropriate

### Common Pitfalls

- Always handle errors properly
- Don't ignore context cancellation
- Be careful with goroutine lifecycle
- Avoid blocking operations in hot paths
- Clean up resources (files, connections)
